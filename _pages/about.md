I'm **Jiwon Kim**, who lives within a dream shaped by hopeful visions of the future.
I believe that emotions which energize life—such as passion and happiness—originate from dreams and goals, and I am living in pursuit of my own aspirations.
I am fascinated by the belief that computing systems of extreme scales—either very large or very small—will become central to the world, and by the goal of enabling such systems to deliver high performance while faithfully reflecting the demands of the real world.  
(For a more details of my dreams and goals, please refer to the following [blog post](https://www.google.com))


Toward this goal, I'm going to contribute to solving real-world problems through a variety of approaches, spanning both research and entrepreneurship.   
I am currently based in South Korea and am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at Seoul National University, where I am engaged in related research. 
In addition, I actively communicate within various startup communities in Korea and enjoy thinking through the stages required to design businesses as a means of addressing the problem which I want to solve.

If you share similar dreams or thinking, I would be delighted to connect and have a conversation via [email](). 
Even if not, you are always welcome to reach out if you would like to talk. 
You may also see more about my thoughts and experiences through my [various blog posts]().  
(From time to time, I also post miscellaneous writings related to everyday life 😊)
