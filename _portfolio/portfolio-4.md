I managed a wide range of physical server infrastructure and software stacks for the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at SNU as a member of Bacchus, the university’s computer systems club. 
For example, We developed a low-latency PC management system that statefully maintains user images and synchronizes them in real time over Network File System, enabling convenient centralized management of all PCs in the hardware laboratory. Also, We built a student account management system "SNUCSE ID" and database used across the entire department, and based on this, enabled OIDC authentication to be provided to various services. Furthermore, We clustered the GPU and CPU servers under the Department of Computer Science and Engineering using Kubernetes and Proxmox, and managed the storage as a Ceph-based distributed system to further improve overall resource utilization.
