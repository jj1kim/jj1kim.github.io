Carewise is a web-application project for young adults, who are unfamiliar with clothing management. We identified key pain points in clothing care for young adults living alone and proposed AI as a solution to information scarcity.
After that, we fine-tuned a language foundation model to deliver expert-level clothing care advice and developed a web service that analyzes care labels to generate personalized maintenance tips. Also, we designed and deployed a low-latency web infrastructure, enabling the service to scale effectively.
This project carried out as part of SNU Likelion, the student club for technological entrepreneurs.
